# Adhoc Plugin

Unreal plugin code for Adhoc (final name to be decided).

https://github.com/SpeculativeCoder/AdhocPlugin

This is a work in progress, experimental, and subject to major changes.

The eventual ideal/goal of Adhoc is to be a system for running a multi-user, multi-server 3D world in the cloud (e.g. AWS) using Unreal Engine with the HTML5 ES3 (WebGL2) platform plugin.
